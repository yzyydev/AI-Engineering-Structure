## Write a technical documentation

Write a documentation about the ai engineering structure of this project and save it in the README.md file. The documentation should state the advantages of using this type of project structure to work with Claude Code or OpenAI Codex. This type of structure should provide a fundament of efficient and SOTA AI Project engineering / developing workflow. Rather than inputing the commands, docs and feature request directly into the CLI of Claude Code or OpenAI Codex, this structure provide a more structured and efficient way to work with these tools. It should also provide a clear and concise way to document the project and its components. Further with the prime command, the context window can be filled directly with codebase, so the AI can have a better understanding of the project and its components.
