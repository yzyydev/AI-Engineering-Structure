# Specs Directory Overview

This `specs/` folder contains individual feature specification files. Each spec documents a single planned feature—its objectives, design changes, tests, and validation steps—so that Claude Code can consume and implement them consistently.

## Folder Structure

- `specs/`
  - `<feature_name>.md` — one file per feature, named in snake_case.

## Spec File Template

```markdown
# Feature Specification: <Feature Title>

## High Level Objective
- Brief description of the feature goal, context, and benefits.

## Type Changes
### File: `path/to/module.py`
- Describe data type or configuration updates.

## Method Changes
### File: `path/to/workflow.py`
- Describe function or workflow modifications.

## Test Changes
### File: `tests/test_<feature>.py`
- Describe new or updated test cases.

## Self Validation
1. Manual testing steps.
2. Automated testing commands.

## README Update
- **File**: `README.md`
- Outline documentation or example updates.
```

## Spec File Naming
- Specs must be named using snake_case and match the feature identifier in code and CI.
- Filename: `<feature_name>.md` (lowercase, underscores).
- The title inside the spec should use Title Case and match `Feature Specification: ...`.

## Spec Invocation
- Use `@[path/to/spec.md]` in Claude Code conversations to load the spec.
- Syntax:
  ```text
  @[ai_engineering_structure/specs/openai_reasoning.md]
  ```
- This tells Claude to:
  1. Read the feature spec.
  2. Plan implementation steps.
  3. Generate code and tests per spec.

## Use Cases
1. **New Feature Planning**: Draft and review feature requirements before implementation.
2. **Automated Code Generation**: Feed specs to Claude Code to scaffold code.
3. **Design Reviews**: Share specs with stakeholders for feedback.
4. **Documentation**: Serve as living design docs for the project.

## Design Best Practices
1. **Single Responsibility**: One feature per spec file.
2. **Clarity**: Use concise language and bullet lists.
3. **Examples**: Include code snippets where relevant.
4. **Version Control**: Update spec when requirements evolve.
5. **Linking**: Reference related specs and documentation using relative paths.

## Technical Implementation Details
- Specs are stored under `ai_engineering_structure/specs/`.
- Each spec is a standalone Markdown file.
- CLI or scripts can parse spec files to automate test stubs and code scaffolding.
- Integration with `.claude/commands/prime.md` ensures specs are loaded in context.

## Limitations
- Specs do not enforce code correctness; human or CI checks required.
- Spec-driven generation depends on Claude Code's interpretation.
- Large specs may exceed token limits; break into smaller specs if needed.

## Advanced Usage
- **Parameterized Specs**: Use placeholders (e.g., `{MODEL}`, `{ENDPOINT}`) for dynamic generation.
- **Subdirectories**: Organize specs by category (`api/`, `ui/`, `backend/`).
- **Spec Templates**: Create common templates for recurring feature types.
- **Automated Merging**: Tools can merge updated specs into release notes.

## Security Considerations
- Avoid embedding secrets or PII in specs.
- Review specs for sensitive content before sharing with AI.
- Store specs in a secure repo with proper access controls.

## Extending the Spec System
- Create new spec subfolders (e.g., `api/`, `data/`).
- Develop tooling to validate spec completeness.
- Link specs to GitHub issues or project management systems.
- Define metadata (e.g., priority, status) via front-matter if needed.

## Usage

1. Copy the template above into a new file `specs/<feature_name>.md`.
2. Fill each section with feature-specific details.
3. Update `.claude/commands/prime.md` to include the new spec.
4. Provide this folder to Claude Code for implementation.
